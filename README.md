# UI Challenge 2

I'm not finished, but I can't figure out how to make the sprites work. The last thing I did was try to make the default checkbox disappear and replace it with the sprites, but it seems to be invoking the default checkboxes instead, which is... odd. The radio button is just HTML-based still.

## What I did

I spent a lot of time on the text input and select boxes. I ultimately abandoned trying to style the select box after many false starts and dead ends. I think the text input box works as expected (I set a minimum number of characters to 4 so that you would see the validation working as soon as you start typing), however, which is nice.

I put effort into the checkbox and radio button, but, as I said, I couldn't figure out how to use the sprite file, even with Dan graciously trying to help me with it.

The submit button was a matter of adding a hover pseudoclass and inverting the colors manually, so that was easy enough at least.

I have no idea how anyone could be expected to complete this in 3 hours.
